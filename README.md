## 🎥 Video Demo

## 📚 Overview

ARNcode is a web-based learning platform developed using **Flask**, **SQLite**, **Jinja2 templates**, and **HTML/CSS**. It was designed as a dynamic educational hub that supports course creation, user enrollment, modular lesson content, and multi-tiered admin functionality. The project provides a fully animated UI with a dark color palette and custom CSS transitions to create an engaging user experience.

ARNcode was built as a final project for CS50x 2025 and demonstrates the practical application of concepts such as routing, sessions, authentication, role-based access control, file uploading, and form handling.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧑‍🎓 For Users:
- Register and log in using a secure password hashing system.
- View a list of published courses and enroll in them.
- Access structured lessons with videos and formatted content (headings, text blocks, code snippets).
- Request admin access if interested in contributing content.

### 🧑‍🏫 For Admins:
- Create, edit, and delete courses.
- Add lessons to courses using a modular editor (each lesson can include structured JSON-based sections).
- Upload lesson videos stored securely.
- Publish or unpublish lessons and courses.

### 👑 For Head Admins:
- Approve or reject admin access requests.
- Revoke existing admin privileges with reasoning.
- View all registered users and manage accounts (including password resets via email).
- Appear in the “Team” section of the About page.

## 📁 Project Structure & File Overview

### 🔹 `app.py`
Main application entry point that initializes the Flask app, configures extensions (Flask-Mail, SQLAlchemy), and registers blueprints.

### 🔹 `arnhub/`
This folder contains all the application logic split across modules:
- `auth.py`: Routes and logic for user signup, login, logout, and session handling.
- `routes.py`: General user-facing routes like home, course detail, about, etc.
- `admin_routes.py`: Admin dashboard, course and lesson management, user control.
- `decorators.py`: Custom decorators for enforcing login, admin, and head-admin permissions.
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy ORM definitions for `User`, `Course`, `Lesson`, and `AdminRequest`.
- `mail_config.py`: Mail server setup for sending password reset credentials securely.

### 🔹 `templates/`
All HTML templates styled with Tailwind-like CSS and animated transitions:
- `login.html`, `signup.html`: Authentication pages.
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `courses.html`: Public-facing pages.
- `admin/`: Admin dashboard templates including `dashboard.html`, `manage_courses.html`, `lessons_list.html`, `users.html`, etc.
- `view_lesson.html`: Beautifully styled lesson viewer for students with embedded video and content blocks.

### 🔹 `static/styles.css`
Dark-theme stylesheet with custom animations, hover effects, and card-based layouts. Animations are done **purely with CSS** — no JS libraries used.

### 🔹 `instance/`
SQLite databases stored here (`db.sqlite`). This folder is ignored via `.gitignore` and automatically created.

### 🔹 `migrations/`
Folder auto-generated by Flask-Migrate for handling future schema changes (not required for initial version but useful for upgrades).

### 🔹 `.gitignore`
Configured to ignore sensitive and auto-generated files including:
- `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.pyc`, and all database files.

### 🔹 `README.md`
This document.

### 🔹 `requirements.txt`
Lists all Python dependencies (Flask, Flask-Mail, Flask-SQLAlchemy, etc.).

## 🤔 Design Decisions

### Role-Based Access System
To ensure secure access, the system supports **three user roles**:
1. **User** – default role for exploring content.
2. **Admin** – can manage their own courses and lessons.
3. **Head Admin** – has extended rights for approving admins and managing users.

This hierarchy enables scalability and content moderation while preventing abuse of admin rights.

### Modular Lesson Editor (JSON Sections)
Instead of a static `content` field, each lesson has a `sections` field (stored as JSON). This makes it easier to:
- Dynamically render structured blocks (headings, notes, code).
- Extend with new section types later.
- Offer flexibility without writing raw HTML.

### Video Uploads
Lesson videos are uploaded directly through the form and saved to `static/lesson_videos/`. This approach simplifies deployment without needing external storage like AWS or Firebase.

### Dark UI with CSS Animations
The entire frontend uses CSS-only animations (no JavaScript libraries). Cards, buttons, navbars, and overlays animate smoothly to create a polished and modern feel. The color scheme uses **dark blue, purple, red, and black**, ensuring both beauty and accessibility.

### Admin Request System
We added a robust approval system:
- Users can request admin access via a form.
- Head Admins review requests, with options to Approve, Reject (with reason), or Revoke existing access.
- Requests and reasons are tracked and reflected in the user interface.
